# RandomSpot
A generator for random spots to kiss your girlfriend on!

Hello, I'm Nova, creator of Black to Red! I am a small 14-year-old DJ based is Kansas City, Missouri. I've been taking my high school (Park Hill South)'s Computer Science class 1st block. I figured out - I really love Python. So I've been doing fun things in python - like I made an app that recognizes me and significant people in my life. That was a fun but short project. Tonight I made Random Spot!

Another passion of mine other then music is girls. I'm a hopeless romantic, like a big hopeless romantic. So when I finally got with my current girlfriend, Kaye, I was very exited to learn she was also a hopeless romantic. She loves to kiss me, and I love to kiss her! But I've kissed her on the lips a lot. It never gets old, but I also wanted to find more spots to kiss her. So I asked Gemini. It gave me lots of ideas, too many to chose from. So I had a Python program do it for me. But that was just outputting to the VSCode terminal, and closed every time it was done. That sucked. So I made an entire UI, and knew i had to share it with you guys under the Random Spot name (If anyone has a better name please email it to novafoyager@gmail.com. The app chooses from a predetermined list of Spots and Styles. The spot is the spot on your girlfriend's body you want to kiss, and the style is where you kiss her. Thank you for looking into my app!
